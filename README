 -find a way to stream the video without rounding? Maybe pass a duration
 parameter in some way?

1. Download the PCG Random Number Generator (see for example http://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-c.html or https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c).
2. Put it here as a subdirectory and run make inside of it once
3. either add make check empty line or change make tests to make check in order
to have make check in the main directory not fail.
